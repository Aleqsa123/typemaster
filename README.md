## Overview

### The challenge

My challenge was to build out this Typemaster pre-launch landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I enhanced my knowledge in backgrounding. Making separate div for background was helpful, these were helpful for side shapes too. I mastered sizing and position of backgrounds. Filling image color was what I learnd
Mastered making link-buttons with only link tags and padding.

```css
.phone-keyboard {
    width: inherit;
    height: inherit;
    border-radius: 0rem 1rem 1rem 0rem;
    opacity: 0.75;
    mix-blend-mode: multiply;
}

### Continued development

It is time using javascript in projects.


### Useful resources

(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and (https://www.w3schools.com/) - These are amazing sites which helped me in backgrounding, also in flex and grid layouts.
